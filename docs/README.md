# Documentation

The `docs` folder of our monorepo is the one-stop-shop for all Aurelia documentation. This includes not only documentation on how to use Aurelia, but also our core engineering docs, detailing how to work on Aurelia. You'll also find other important documents such as our changelog, code-of-conduct and contributing guide.
